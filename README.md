# Thoughts App
This is a demo web app following a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) Authentication [tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/next-js-authentication-tutorial/#Securing-Next-js-Applications-with-Passport).

The [tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/next-js-authentication-tutorial/#Securing-Next-js-Applications-with-Passport) guides you to create the demo app from scratch and also connect to the Auth0 application you will be creating along the line. I have rewritten my version in Typescript and added a few tweaks.

## Installation
After cloning the repo, create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with the respective env variables (see `.env.template`). Then install the dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Usage
`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
